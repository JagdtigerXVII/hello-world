My first thrust into the progamming world


Hello world
Raf speaking, I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing but I'm going to learn. I care not how difficult it is or how dense I am, I'm going to do this. I like tanks, vidya gaming, computers, and an avid appreciator (is that even a world and did I even spell it right?) of rap music, regardless of how people view it.
